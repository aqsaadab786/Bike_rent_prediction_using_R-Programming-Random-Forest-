This project involves exploratory data analysis and machine learning for predicting daily bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal factors. The tasks include data manipulation, visualization, and model creation using the R programming language.

Bike Rental Prediction Project

## Objectives:
Perform exploratory data analysis and visualize the data to understand the environmental and seasonal settings.
Predict bike rental counts based on environmental and seasonal settings with the help of a machine learning algorithm.

## Prerequisites:
* Exploratory data analysis
* Data manipulation
* Data visualization
* R programming
* Machine learning

## Industry Relevance:

* Exploratory data analysis: It finds trends and patterns, or checks assumptions by analyzing data with visual tools.
* Data manipulation: It organizes and changes information to make it more understandable.
* Data visualization: It represents data with the use of common graphs, plots, or charts.
* R programming: It is used for statistical analysis, graphics representation, and reporting.
* Machine Learning: It helps software programs in being more accurate at predicting outcomes without explicitly programming them to do so.

## Problem Statement:

In bike-sharing systems, the entire process from membership to rental and return has been automated. Using these systems, users can easily rent a bike from one location and return it to another. The bike rental company wants to understand and predict the number of bikes rented daily based on the environment and seasons.

## Dataset Description:

* instant: Record index for unique identification.
* dteday: Date of the recorded data for time-based analysis.
* season: Categorizes data into seasons (spring, summer, fall, winter).
* yr: Indicates the year of the recorded data (2011 or 2012).
* mnth: Represents the month of the recorded data (1 to 12).
* holiday: Indicates whether the day is a holiday or not.
* weekday: Specifies the day of the week for the recorded data.
* workingday: Categorizes the day as a working day or non-working day.
* weathersit: Categorizes weather conditions (Clear, Mist, Light snow, Heavy rain).
* temp: Normalized temperature in Celsius (values divided into 41).
* atemp: Normalized feeling temperature in Celsius (values divided into 50).
* hum: Normalized humidity (values divided into 100).
* windspeed: Normalized wind speed (values divided into 67).
* casual: Count of casual users who rented bikes.
* registered: Count of registered users who rented bikes.
* cnt: Total count of rental bikes (casual + registered).

Step 7: Data Preprocessing
* Split the Dataset:Use functions like createDataPartition() to split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  
Step 8: Machine Learning
* Create a Model (Random Forest):
* Implement a machine learning model using the random forest algorithm. Utilize functions like randomForest().
* Prediction on Test Dataset:
* Use the trained model to predict bike rental counts on the test dataset.
  
step 9: Model Evaluation Metrics
* R-squared score
* Root mean square error
* Mean absolute error
